IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

Danger
Exposure to extremely high noise levels may cause a permanent
hearing loss. Individuals vary considerably to noise induced hearing
loss but nearly everyone will lose some hearing if exposed to sufficiently
intense noise for a sufficient time. The U.S. Government's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified
the following permissible noise level exposures:

DURATION PER DAY (HOURS) 8 6 4 3 2 1
SOUND LEVEL (dB)

90 93 95 97 100 103

According to OSHA, any exposure in the above permissible limits could
result in some hearing loss. Ear plugs or protectors in the ear canal or over
the ears must be worn when operating this amplification system in order to
prevent a permanent hearing loss. If exposure in excess of the limits as
put forth above, to insure against potentially harmful exposure to high
sound pressure levels, it is recommended that all persons exposed to
equipment capable of inducing high sound pressure levels, such as this
amplification system, be protected by hearing protectors while this unit is in
operation.

Quick Start Guide
Your Essentia Audio Distribution System is quick and easy to install. This guide outlines the necessary steps for
an accurate and successful installation, and years of audio enjoyment.
Step 1:
Check your package for all of the components. Your box should contain the following items:
1
NV-E6DMS 6-source, 6-zone digital audio distribution amplifier
6
NV-E6DKPC keypads, with 1 bag of preprinted source buttons, ivory, and almond
replacement keypad inserts for each
1

Installation manual
Step 2:
Place the Essentia amplifier in its preferred location. The Essentia amplifier is designed to be located in the central media area where the home’s audio sources will be housed.
Step 3:
The Essentia amplifier should be turned on before any other cables are plugged in. This activates internal protective circuitry. Once the Essentia amplifier is turned on, it should be left on.
Step 4:
When the amplifier is in its location and turned on, the audio sources can be connected using stereo RCA cables.
These cables connect the left and right channels from the audio output of the source equipment to the appropriate source input on the Essentia amplifier. The IR (infrared) emitters should be plugged into the IR outputs on
the back of the amplifier and attached to the IR window of the corresponding source equipment.
Step 5:
Each of the Cat-5 cables from the zones should be crimped with an RJ-45 connector using 568A or 568B wiring
(see page for Cat-5 crimping instructions). Test each Cat-5 connection using a cable tester before proceeding
with the installation. Each cable plugs into one of the RJ-45 connection jacks on the back of the supplied EZ Port.
It is important for future reference to label each cat-5 cable for its appropriate listening zone. The order in which
they are plugged into the EZ Port is irrelevant to the system’s operation.
Step 6:
Install the EZ Port in a standard dual gang low voltage bracket. We recommend the Carlon SC100R "Old Work
Bracket", or the SC100A "New Construction Bracket". These are designed for low voltage electronics and have an
open back for easy access to the back of the EZ Port.

6

Step 7:
Connect the provided pre-terminated network Cable in the RJ-45 connection jack on the front of the EZ Port and
in the Network Connection on the back of the Essentia amplifier.
Step 8:
Each zone is easily set using the DIP switches located on the back of the keypad. Switches 1-4 are used to set a
unique address for each zone and are noted with a "1" indicating the down position of the switch and a "O" indicating the up position. Refer to the chart on the back of the keypad for the correct switch position for each zone.
Page 17 provides a visual reference of all of the available switch settings.
Step 9:
Switches 5, 6, & 7 are used to adjust the amount of bass and treble response in each zone. There are eight possible settings. The choices are a bass and treble boost, two levels of bass boost, two levels of treble boost, bass cut,
treble cut, or flat. The positions for these settings are also shown as "1" for down and "O" for up and are shown on
page 18.
Step 10:
Switch 8 allows multiple zones to share the same source. This is useful for large living spaces such as a kitchen,
breakfast nook, and dinning room where there are no walls defining each room. When switch 8 is in the up "O"
position, all keypads with the same setting will then always turn on at the same source. This does, however,
allow individual volume and on/off control. This setting is shown on page 18.
Step 11:
Switch 9 sets the volume level when the zone is turned on. The choices are to have the zone turn on at the same
level it was at when it was previously turned off (switch 9 in the down "1" position), or to turn on at a low volume
level (switch 9 in the up "O" position). This setting is shown on page 19.
Step 12:
Once the desired switch settings have been made for each keypad and they have been installed in their zone locations, you will be able to turn each zone on and off, control volume, and choose audio sources independently.
These functions can also be done wirelessly using the NuVo RC2 remote control. The built-in IR receiver in each
keypad also allows for direct control of the audio source equipment using that equipment’s remote control or a
universal learning remote control.

The correct wiring scheme for the Cat-5 wire is standard EIA/TIA 568A, which is the industry standard for
computer networking. Properly terminating the Cat-5
wire is crucial for the operation of the system. It is
very important to use a good quality crimp tool, and
testing each termination with a Cat-5 wire tester will
insure that your system operates flawlessly.

1. Strip a 2 to 3 inch portion of the insulation, exposing the 4 twisted pairs.
2. Untwist the wires and fan them out individually.
Arrange the wires into the correct color scheme.
Note that each of the wires is either a solid color, or
a white wire with a colored stripe. The colors are
green, orange, blue, and brown. The colors need to

them evenly across the top. Most crimp tools have a
wire trimmer built-in. It is best to trim the wires to
about 1/2" in length.
4. While holding the wires flat between your thumb
and forefinger, insert the wires into the RJ45 connector, so each wire is in its own slot. Push the wire
into the RJ45, so all 8 conductors touch the end of

Installing the Essentia Amplifier

System setup works best when the amplifier is placed
in the same location as the audio source equipment.
This is typically in an audio rack, entertainment center
or a closet dedicated to housing the home audio/video
equipment.
The amplifier should be plugged in and the power button on the front panel should be depressed before proceeding with the rest of the installation. This activates
the internal protective circuitry of the Essentia
System.

III. Installing the NV-E6DEZP EZ
Port (Fig. 2)
The EZ Port is a multi-connection hub designed to
accept all the Cat-5 wires from the keypads in the system. The location of the EZ Port should be determined
by the location of the Essentia amplifier. It is best to
place in the wall behind the amplifier that would be
easily accessible if necessary.
The EZ Port fits easily in any dual-gang size construction bracket with an open back. These are often
referred to as "mud rings". Simply plug the terminated
Cat-5 wires into any of the sixteen available jacks on
the back of the EZ Port. The order in which the individual Cat-5 wires is plugged in not important, although it
is strongly recommended that you label the Cat-5 with
the appropriate zone number for future reference.

Fig. 2

Once you have plugged the Cat-5 wires into the EZ
Port, screw the EZ Port into its construction bracket
using the supplied mounting screws.

The supplied pre-terminated network cable can then be
plugged into the jack on the EZ Port and into the network connection on the back of the Essentia amplifier,
Any Cat-5 cable terminated using 568A or 568B network wiring will suffice should you need a longer connection.

(Fig. 5)

Fig. 5

IR commands for the source equipment are transferred
from the Essentia amplifier to the source equipment
via mini IR mouse emitters. Six of these are supplied
with your Essentia System. The emitter is plugged
into the corresponding source IR output on the
Essentia and then placed over the IR receiver window
on the source component. The IR outputs are individually routed to sources 1-6.
The two SUM outputs will flash any IR command that
is sent from any of the zones. This is used to connect
the NuVo T3 Tuner to the Essentia System or an IR
blaster designed to flash IR commands to a variety of
components. This is done by plugging a single mono
1/8" patch cable into the SUM IR output and into the
Direct IR input on the T3.

IX. Setting the Zone Address DIP
Switches (Fig. 8)

Zone 1

The first four switches on the keypads are designed to
create a specific binary address identifying each zone
to the amplifier. Setting each zone address is easy, but
it is important to note that each keypad must have its
own unique setting.
Each switch can either be placed in an up or down position. The chart on each keypad indicates the switch
position using a "1" for the switch in its down position,
and "0" for the switch in its up position. Thus, the setting for Zone 1 is 1000, or switch #1 in the down position and switches #2-4 in the up position.
Once each keypad is set for its zone, you should be able
to control volume, change the source selection, and
turn the zone on or off. The corresponding zone LED
on the face of the amplifier will turn on when the zone
keypad is turned on.

XI. Source Grouping (Fig. 11)
Switch 8 is used to set a source group. This is a useful
feature for large open living areas that do not have
defined spaces separated by walls. In these areas it is
not practical to have two or more sources playing at
the same time.

Fig. 11: Switch 8 Audio Source Grouping
Independent Source
Selection

When a keypad has switch 8 in the up position, it will
share the same source selection as any other keypad in
the system that also has switch 8 in the up position.
This allows those zones to all play the same source
when turned on, but still maintain individual volume
control.

XIII. Parental Lock
A unique feature of the Essentia keypad is the ability
to lock the keypad functions once an audio selection is
made. This is done by pressing the button for the
selected source for approximately four seconds. The
keypad will flash indicating that it is locked. Once it is
locked it will not respond to any button pushes. To
unlock the keypad, simply press and hold the selected
source button again for approximately four seconds.
When the keypad flashes, it is then unlocked and will
then perform any of its functions.

XIII. The NV-RC2 IR Remote Control
(Fig. 13)
The Essentia System comes with the RC2 remote control. This remote allows wireless control of all of the
keypad functions, as well as the functions of the NuVo
T3 Tuner. The four-backlit buttons at the top of the
remote allow you to choose which device the remote
will control. The numeric keypad is used to choose the
desired audio source, or tuner preset.

NV-RC2 Remote

The RC2 remote is an ideal tool for teaching the NuVo
System functions to a universal learning remote control that can then operate the Essentia system as well
as all the individual source functions.

XIV. Changing the Buttons on the
Essentia Keypad (Fig. 14)
The Essentia keypads ship with 36 preprinted interchangeable source buttons. This allows you to easily
customize each keypad to match the audio components
being used in the system.

To change the buttons use a small screwdriver to
remove the outer Decora insert. This exposes two inner
plates that hold the buttons in place. Those are also
removed with a small screwdriver, allowing you to
remove and replace the desired source buttons.
Line up the tabs on the replacement buttons with the
corresponding holes in the keypad’s circuit board.
Once the new buttons are in place return the inner
plates and the outer keypad insert.

Essentia Accessories
NV-MI1 Mute Interface Adapter (Fig. 15)
The Mute Interface is used in conjunction with System Mute input in the back of the Essentia amplifier. It acts
as a relay for a voltage from up to two phone lines and two doorbell transformers. When a voltage is presented to
the MI1 it then sends a contact closure to the Essentia System, which in turn causes the system to mute momentarily. This is useful in allowing the telephone ring or doorbell to be heard when audio is playing in any of the
zones.

NV-LSI12 Local Source Interrupt (Fig. 16)
The Local Source Interrupt enables an amplified local audio source to override the Essentia System and play
through the local zone in-wall speakers. The most common scenario for this is a TV that would benefit from
higher quality speakers.

The connection from the LSI12 is
done with the provided two prong
plug. Make sure that red is positive
and black is negative when splicing
the two conductor wire from the LSI12.

The selected zone speaker output of the Essentia or Simplese
amplifier is wired directly to the LSI12.

There are two methods for triggering the P2100 from the
Essentia outputs. One is to set the POWER MODE switch
on the P2100 to Audio (the extreme left position) and allow
an incoming audio signal from the Essentia System to turn
on the P2100. The second method is to place the POWER
MODE switch in the AC/DC (extreme right) position. This
will turn on the P2100 when the Essentia is on. An additional feature of Essentia is zone specific triggers that will
trigger the P2100 only when that zone is turned on.
Utilizing the voltage trigger requires a mono 1/8" patch
cable from either the System ON output on the Essentia to
the P2100 Voltage trigger input, or from the specific Zone
Trigger on the Essentia to the Voltage Trigger on the P2100,
as shown in Fig. 18.

Troubleshooting
Symptom

Probable Cause

Remedy

When the keypad is plugged in
there is a loud pop through the
speakers and the keypad does
not work.

Improperly wired Cat-5 cable.

Check that you are using the
568A wiring standard. (See
Section I: Crimping Cat-5 Wire)

My keypad is lit, but nothing
happens when I press a button.

Assigning identical addresses to
more than one keypad usually
causes this.

Each keypad MUST have a
unique address as set by DIP
switches 1-4. (See Section IX:
Setting Zone Addresses)

The amplifier is plugged in and
turned on, but the STAND BY
LED is not lit and none of the
system functions work.

This is most likely caused by a
blown fuse on the power supply.

The fuse is accessed at the back
of the amplifier where the AC
cord plugs in. It requires a 4 amp
time delay fuse.

All the keypads change when a
source is selected on only one.

DIP Switch # 8 is in the up “O”
position.

Place DIP Switch # 8 in the down
“1” position. This will turn off
the source grouping feature.

With the keypads plugged in, the One or more improperly wired
POWER light on the front of the Cat-5 cables.
amplifier will not turn on.

Make sure the amplifier is
turned on. Test that the POWER
light on the amplifier turns on
when the Network Cable is
unplugged. Next unplug all the
Cat-5 cables from the EZ Port
and plug them back in one at a
time until the bad cable is discovered.

The IR repeater does not properly control the audio source
equipment.

One or more of the IR emitters
are not properly placed over the
IR receiver on the audio source
equipment, or the IR output on
the Essentia does not correspond
with the audio source equipment
you are controlling.

24

Reposition the LED end of the
emitter on the face of the source
equipment, so it is flashing
directly over the IR receiver.
Make sure that the emitter
plugged into IR Output # 1 is
actually going to source # 1, and
so on for sources 2 - 6.

Control Interface Description Document for the Nuvo E6D Main Unit
Revision B
November 26, 2003
DB9M PORT PINOUTS:

Nuvo Transmit to System Controller on pin 2.
Nuvo Receive from System Controller on pin 3.
Ground on pin 5.

SERIAL PORT PARAMETERS: RS232, RTS/CTS or software flow control (XON/XOFF) NOT required, 9600 baud, 8N1 protocol.
RULES OF PROTOCOL:
(1) For alpha ASCII characters, always use UPPER CASE. In this document, actual characters in a string are presented in BOLD type.
(2) All numerical fields are coded as ASCII digit characters.
(3) Each Command string is STARTED with an ASCII "*" character and terminated by a <CR> character (0D hexadecimal). Each
response string issued by the E6D will START with an ASCII "#" and be terminated with a <CR> character (0D hexadecimal).
(4) If a command has an error in it (does not adhere to exact command syntax), the E6D will respond with a "#?<CR>" string.
(5) Whenever queuing multiple commands to the E6D, the host program should pause for 50 milliseconds between commands to prevent buffer overruns.
NUVO POWER-ON STATE:
(1) Each zone is OFF until ON command is received.
(2) Each zone’s ZoneSet status will be as set by the local keypad DIP switches
If no keypad is connected with a given zone address, then ZoneSet will default to:
A. OR0 (No override)
B. BASS+0 (Bass FLAT)
C. TREB+0 (Treble FLAT)
D. GRP0 (SOURCE GROUPING OFF)
E. VRST1 (VOLUME RESET TO –50 dB ON)
If these zone settings are overridden by the commands which follow in this document, the overridden values will reset to the default
values above upon cycling power on the Main Unit.
(3) For the first four seconds after power-on, a series of non-control related characters will be issued at a wide range of baud rates.
These are necessary queries to a program that may be running on a connected PC for the purpose of firmware field upgrades.
They should be ignored by the host control system.
NON-VOLATILE COMMANDS AND ASSOCIATED RESPONSE: With the exception of commands associated with setting the IR carrier frequency, the
effect of all commands is non-permanent; i.e. when power is cycled on the main unit, it will return to default values. The commands that are an
exception to this rule follow in this section.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*IRSETSR<CR> – Reads status of SOURCE IR carrier frequency settings.
RESPONSE:
#IRSET:aa,bb,cc,dd,ee,ff<CR> where:
aa = IR carrier frequency of SOURCE 1 ("38" or "56")
bb = carrier frequency of SOURCE 2 ("38" or "56")
cc = carrier frequency of SOURCE 3 ("38" or "56")
dd = carrier frequency of SOURCE 4 ("38" or "56")
ee = carrier frequency of SOURCE 5 ("38" or "56")
ff = carrier frequency of SOURCE 6 ("38" or "56")
NOTE – the Main Unit ships with the carrier frequency DEFAULT setting of
38 KHz for all six sources.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*IRSETDF<CR> – Restores DEFAULT SOURCE IR carrier frequency settings (38 KHz for all six sources).
RESPONSE: Same response as for #IRSETSR<CR>
*********************************************************************************

26

COMMAND:
RESPONSE:

*SxIR56SET<CR> - sets SOURCE x to 56 KHz IR repeat carrier (x is 1 to 6).
Same response as for #IRSETSR<CR>

*********************************************************************************
COMMAND: *SxIR38SET<CR> - sets SOURCE x to 38 KHz IR repeat carrier (x is 1 to 6).
RESPONSE: Same response as for #IRSETSR<CR>
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND/RESPONSE DESCRIPTIONS.
NOTE – zone number field xx should ALWAYS
Include a lead zero ("0") for zone numbers less than 10.
COMMAND:
RESPONSE:

*ZxxCONSR<CR> - Connect STATUS REQUEST where xx is zone # from 1 to 12.
#ZxxPWRppp,SRCs,GRPt,VOL-yy<CR>
-ppp = "ON" (2 characters)
or "OFF" (3 characters)
-s = SOURCE NUMBER 1 to 6
-q = 0 if SOURCE GROUP is ON
1 if SOURCE GROUP is OFF
-yy = level below max in dB: -00 to -79 dB
(include lead 0 for all single-digit values)
-yy = "MT" if in MUTE state
-yy = "XM" if external MUTE is being held active

This response will also be issued in response to pressing the ON/OFF, VOLUME, or SOURCE
keys on a KEYPAD. NOTE – the response will be issued if a SOURCE key is press`ed on a
zone that is powered OFF even though the key press has no effect on the system. It will be
output at every increment during a volume ramp initiated by HOLDING a VOLUME UP or
VOLUME DOWN key on a keypad. It will also be issued at every increment of a volume
ramp commanded by the *ZxxVOL+<CR> and *ZxxVOL-<CR> commands (see below).
The MUTE value will be asserted if a *ZxMTON<CR> command has been received, OR if the
volume is run all the way to the lowest possible point (volume off). An active EXTERNAL
MUTE input, however, will always override other volume response values with the "XM"
response.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ZxxSETSR<CR> – ZoneSet STATUS REQUEST where xx is zone # from 1 to 12.
RESPONSE: #ZxxORp,BASSyy,TREByy,GRPq,VRSTr<CR>-p = 1 if DIP switches are overridden*
0 if DIP switches are in control
-yy = EQ level, dB, –8 to +0 (flat) to
+8 in 1 dB increments
-q = 0 if SOURCE GROUP is ON
1 if SOURCE GROUP is OFF
(This follows DIP switch definition.)
-r =

0 if VOLUME RESET is ON
1 if VOLUME RESET is OFF
(This follows DIP switch definition.)

*override set to 1 FOR THIS ZONE only if one of commands *ZxxBASSyy<CR>, *ZxxTREByy<CR>, *ZxxGRPq<CR>, or *ZxxVRSTr<CR> are issued (see
descriptions below).

27

Once it is SET by one of these commands:
a. It will remain set until power is cycled on the unit.
b. Non-address DIP switch changes on a connected KEYPAD connected to this zone will be ignored.
If override state is "0", this response is also issued whenever non-address KEYPAD DIP switches are changed.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ZxxON<CR> – Turn zone xx ON.
RESPONSE:
Same response as for *ZxxCONSR<CR>
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ZxxOFF<CR> – Turn zone xx OFF.
RESPONSE:
Same response as for *ZxxCONSR<CR>
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ALLOFF<CR> – Turn ALL zones OFF.
RESPONSE:
#ALLOFF<CR>
This RESPONSE is also issued when ALL OFF is pressed on any KEYPAD.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ALLV+<CR> – Ramp ALL zones UP at a 10 dB/second rate in 1 dB steps.
RESPONSE:
#ALLV+<CR>
The ramp action will be cancelled when all zones reach MAXIMUM volume, or when an *ALLHLD<CR> Command is received. Note that to stop the
ramp with this command before maximum volume, one reference zone must be periodically polled with a *ZxxCONSR<CR> Command to determine
when the desired volume point has been reached. Note that ramps in different zones may start at different levels and will all ramp at the same
rate.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ALLV-<CR> – Ramp ALL zones DOWN at a 10 dB/second rate in 1 dB steps.
RESPONSE:
#ALLV-<CR>
The ramp action will be cancelled when all zones reach MINIMUM (OFF) volume, or when an *ALLHLD<CR> Command is received. Note that to
stop the ramp with this command before the minimum volume, one reference zone must be periodically polled with a *ZxxCONSR<CR> Command
to determine when the desired volume point has been reached. Note that ramps in different zones may start at different levels and will all ramp
at the same rate.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ALLHLD<CR> – Stops ramp action initiated by *ALLV+<CR> Or *ALLV-<CR>
RESPONSE:
#ALLHLD-<CR>
This results in a HOLD of the level at time of command receipt.
*********************************************************************************
COMMAND:
*ALLMON<CR> – ALL MUTE ON.
